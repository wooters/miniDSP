Step-by-step guides for DSP concepts using the miniDSP library.
Each tutorial explains the theory, walks through a working example,
and shows the resulting plots.

- \subpage magnitude-spectrum — Decompose a signal into its frequency components using the DFT.
- \subpage power-spectral-density — Measure how signal power distributes across frequencies.
