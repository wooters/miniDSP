Step-by-step guides for DSP concepts using the miniDSP library.
Each tutorial explains the theory, walks through a working example,
and shows the resulting plots.

- \subpage signal-generators — Generate test signals (sine waves, white noise, impulse, chirp, and more).
- \subpage window-functions — Compare Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, and rectangular windows for FFT analysis.
- \subpage magnitude-spectrum — Decompose a signal into its frequency components using the DFT.
- \subpage power-spectral-density — Measure how signal power distributes across frequencies.
- \subpage stft-spectrogram — Visualise how a signal's frequency content changes over time.
- \subpage phase-spectrum — Inspect the per-frequency phase angle of a real signal.
- \subpage basic-signal-operations — RMS, zero-crossing rate, autocorrelation, peak detection, and signal mixing.
- \subpage simple-effects — Delay/echo, tremolo, and comb-filter reverb.
- \subpage fir-convolution — Time-domain convolution, moving-average FIR, general FIR, and FFT overlap-add fast convolution.
